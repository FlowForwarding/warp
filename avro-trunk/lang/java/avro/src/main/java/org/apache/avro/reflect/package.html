<body>
Use Java reflection to generate schemas and protocols for existing
classes.

<p>Java types are mapped to Avro schemas as follows:

<ul>

<li><b>Classes</b> are mapped to Avro records. Only concrete classes
  with a no-argument constructor are supported.  All inherited fields
  that are not static or transient are used.  Fields are not permitted
  to be null unless annotated by {@link
  org.apache.avro.reflect.Nullable Nullable} or a {@link
  org.apache.avro.reflect.Union Union} containing null.</li>

<li><b>Arrays</b> are mapped to Avro array schemas.  If an array's
  elements are a union defined by the {@link
  org.apache.avro.reflect.Union Union} annotation, the "java-element"
  property is set to the union's class, e.g.:
  <pre>{"type": "array", "java-element": "org.acme.Foo"}</pre>
</li>

<li><b>Collection</b> implementations are mapped to Avro array schemas
  with the "java-class" property set to the collection
  implementation, e.g.:
  <pre>{"type": "array", "java-class": "java.util.ArrayList"}</pre>
</li>

<li><b>{@link java.lang.String}</b> is mapped to an Avro string schema.</li>

<li><b>byte[]</b> is mapped to an Avro bytes schema.</li>

<li><b>short</b> is mapped to an Avro int schema with the "java-class"
  property set to "java.lang.Short", e.g.:
  <pre>{"type": "int", "java-class": "java.lang.Short"}</pre>

<li>All other types are mapped as in the {@link org.apache.avro.generic
  generic} API.</li>

</ul>

<p>The {@link org.apache.avro.reflect.Union Union} annotation can be used
to support reflection of schemas for interfaces, abstract base classes
and other uses of polymorphism.

<p>The {@link org.apache.avro.reflect.Stringable Stringable} annotation
will cause a type to be serialized via its {@link java.lang.Object#toString()
toString} method.
